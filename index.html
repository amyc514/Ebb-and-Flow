    <p>As designers, we aspire for our message to be conveyed perfectly across every way you can view it. We control, and limit ourselves to such tight constraints because if our message is portrayed how we want it in one medium; it must look the same throughout
        all. When it comes to web design we must consider many factors such as the medium and how it is different from print, the accessibility, and the functionality. We must remember to focus on the entire hierarchy and not let the idea of design grab
        our attention away. The idea of control needs to be loosen up and we need to let things flow and be more flexible. Eventually when we allow that to happen we are adapting and before you know it, the design is already coming along.</p>
    <p>In print, many fonts are available to us, however in web it is not as common but it is workable. Font size should be your focus, considering those with bad eyesight and those with good eyesight can change how your audience views it. Layout is also
        helpful with readability. Finally when it comes to color, don’t rely on it to convey your message. The use of style sheets can be very helpful, just remember not to control the page.</p>
    <p>Your audience is important, font sizes, color, and layout all must flow in order for it to be accessible and capture the message. Web design shouldn’t be seen as a limitation in portraying what you want. Allow adaptability and flow to happen.</p>
