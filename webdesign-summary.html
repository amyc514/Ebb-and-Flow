<h4><a id="By_Amy_Chan_1"></a>By Amy Chan</h4>
<p>As designers, we aspire for our message to be conveyed perfectly across every way<br>
you can view it. We control, and limit ourselves to such tight constraints because<br>
if our message is portrayed how we want it in one medium; it must look the same<br>
throughout all. When it comes to web design we must consider many factors such as the<br>
medium and how it is different from print, the accessibility, and the functionality.<br>
We must remember to focus on the entire hierarchy and not let the idea of design grab<br>
our attention away. The idea of control needs to be loosen up and we need to let things<br>
flow and be more flexible. Eventually when we allow that to happen we are adapting and<br>
before you know it, the design is already coming along.</p>
<p>In print, many fonts are available to us, however in web it is not as common but it is<br>
workable. Font size should be your focus, considering those with bad eyesight and those<br>
with good eyesight can change how your audience views it. Layout is also helpful with<br>
readability. Finally when it comes to color, don’t rely on it to convey your message.<br>
your message. The use of style sheets can be very helpful, just remember not to<br>
control the page.</p>
<p>Your audience is important, font sizes, color, and layout all must flow in order for it<br>
to be accessible and capture the message. Web design shouldn’t be seen as a limitation<br>
in portraying what you want. Allow adaptability and flow to happen.</p>
